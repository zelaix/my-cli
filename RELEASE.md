# Create a new file with AI assistance
my-cli chat "Write a Python file that calculates fibonacci numbers"

# Edit existing files
my-cli chat "Add error handling to the main function in app.py"
```

### 3. **Subagent Specialization** (Easy-Medium)
```bash
# Trigger Code Review Specialist
my-cli chat "Review the authentication code in auth.py for security vulnerabilities"
# Output: ü§ñ Using code-reviewer specialist...

# Trigger Debug Specialist  
my-cli chat "Debug this error: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'username'"
# Output: ü§ñ Using debug-specialist specialist...

# Code quality analysis
my-cli chat "Analyze the code quality in the user management module"
# Output: ü§ñ Using code-reviewer specialist...
```

### 4. **Codebase Exploration** (Medium)
```bash
# Find specific patterns in code
my-cli chat "Find all TODO comments in the entire codebase"

# Discover files with specific patterns
my-cli chat "List all Python test files in the project"

# Complex search operations
my-cli chat "Find all functions that use the 'requests' library and show me their implementations"
```

### 5. **Web Integration** (Medium)

# Research latest information
my-cli chat "Search for the latest Python security best practices and summarize them"

# Analyze web content
my-cli chat "Fetch the content from https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ and explain the key concepts"

AI: [Reads and shows file contents]

You: "What security issues do you see?"
AI: ü§ñ Using code-reviewer specialist...
    [Provides detailed security analysis]

You: "Fix the most critical issue"
AI: [Implements fix with explanation]

You: "Test the changes"

```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

### **Subagent System**
- **Fixed Specialists**: Only 2 hardcoded subagents (code-reviewer, debug-specialist)
- **Pattern-Based Matching**: Uses simple regex patterns for task delegation
- **No Custom Subagents**: Cannot create or configure custom specialist agents
- **No Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Subagents work independently, no chaining

### **Context Management**
- **No Auto-Summarization**: When context limit is reached, conversation may be truncated
- **Session-Only Memory**: Cross-turn memory only works within single interactive session
- **No Persistent History**: Conversation history is lost when session ends
- **Limited Context Awareness**: No long-term project context retention

### **Model Support**
- **Kimi K2 Only**: Preview version limited to Kimi models (kimi-k2-instruct, kimi-k2-base)
- **Single Provider**: No multi-provider support in this release
- **API Dependency**: Requires stable internet connection and valid API keys

### **Tool System**
- **No MCP Integration**: Cannot connect to external Model Context Protocol servers
- **Limited Git Support**: Basic file operations only, no advanced version control features
- **No Plugin System**: Cannot add custom tools dynamically
- **Web Search Dependency**: Web tools require third-party API keys for best results

### **Error Handling**
- **Basic Recovery**: Limited error recovery and retry mechanisms
- **API Rate Limits**: May hit rate limits with intensive usage
- **Network Dependencies**: Web tools fail gracefully but provide limited offline functionality

### **Performance**
- **No Caching**: Repeated operations don't benefit from caching
- **Sequential Processing**: Tool calls executed sequentially, not in parallel
- **Memory Usage**: Large files or long conversations may consume significant memory

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "API key not found" error**
```bash
# Make sure your API key is set
export MY_CLI_KIMI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key"
my-cli config --show  # Verify key is loaded
```

**2. Web search not working**
```bash
# Web search requires additional API keys
export SERPER_API_KEY="your-serper-key"  # Recommended
# Or set up alternative providers (see configuration section)
```

**3. Subagents not triggering**
```bash
# Make sure to use trigger keywords:
# For code review: "review", "security", "audit", "quality"
# For debugging: "debug", "error", "bug", "troubleshoot"

# Example:
my-cli chat "Please review this code"      # ‚úÖ Triggers code-reviewer
my-cli chat "Look at this code"           # ‚ùå Won't trigger specialist
```

**4. Interactive mode commands**
```bash
# In interactive mode, use these commands:
/help     # Show available commands
/stats    # View conversation statistics
/clear    # Clear conversation history
/stream   # Toggle streaming mode
/exit     # Exit interactive mode
```
